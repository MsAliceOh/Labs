            Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms
            by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of
            cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme
            rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds
            on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.
