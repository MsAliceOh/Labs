            Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms
            by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of
            cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme
            rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds
            on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.

            There is some debate as to the best way to store cheese, but some experts[who?] say that wrapping it in
            cheese paper provides optimal results. Cheese paper is coated in a porous plastic on the inside, and the
            outside has a layer of wax. This specific combination of plastic on the inside and wax on the outside
            protects the cheese by allowing condensation on the cheese to be wicked away while preventing moisture
            from within the cheese escaping.

            A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger. Becoming an expert in this field
            requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience, much like becoming an expert
            in wine or cuisine. The cheesemonger is responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory: selecting the
            cheese menu, purchasing, receiving, storage, and ripening.
